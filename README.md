## lily-pwsh
## A clean, minimal, zero‑drift PowerShell container built on Ubuntu 24.04.

lily-pwsh is a sterile, reproducible PowerShell environment designed for people who want a predictable shell without host contamination, leftover apt cache, or the bloat of full Linux installs. It’s intentionally simple: build it, run it, throw it away. The image is the only persistent artifact.

## ✨ Features
**Minimal Ubuntu 24.04 base**
- Correct Microsoft repo for PowerShell
- No leftover apt cache or build debris
- Starts directly in pwsh
- Ephemeral by design — containers are disposable
- Optional persistent data directory via bind mount
- Works cleanly from Windows Terminal using SSH keys

## ⚠️ Prerequisites
This project assumes:

You already have Docker installed on your Linux host
(If not, check your distro’s documentation or Docker’s official install guide.)

You remember to mark any scripts in the scripts/ folder as executable
```
chmod +x scripts/<scriptname>
```

## 🔧 Dockerfile Reminder Path
The Dockerfile includes a startup reminder:
```
CMD ["-NoLogo", "-Command", "Write-Host 'Reminder: Run ./mnt/data/bootstrap/Install-AzureModules.ps1' -ForegroundColor Yellow; pwsh"]
```
This prints a message every time the container starts, reminding you to run your module‑install script from the persistent data mount.

If you store your script in a different location inside ```/mnt/data```, update the reminder path in the Dockerfile accordingly. The reminder is intentionally hard‑coded so users don’t forget to install modules into the persistent mount instead of baking them into the image.

## 🛠️ Building the Image
From the repo root:
```
docker build -t lily-pwsh .
```

This produces a clean, minimal PowerShell image with no drift and no cached apt layers.

## ▶️ Running the Container
Basic interactive shell
```docker run --rm -it lily-pwsh``` 
or 
```scripts/run-pwsh.sh```

With a persistent data directory
```
docker run --rm -it \
-v "$HOME/pwsh-data:/mnt/data" \
lily-pwsh
```

Anything placed in /mnt/data inside the container persists between runs.

## 🪟 Using It from Windows Terminal (SSH‑based workflow)
I run this container from Windows Terminal using SSH keys to authenticate to my Linux host. This avoids passwords, reduces friction, and makes the workflow feel native.

Example Windows Terminal profile command:

```
ssh -t <your-linux-user>@<your-linux-host> /home/<your-linux-user>/run-pwsh.sh
```

If someone needs SSH keys:
```
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
ssh-copy-id your-linux-host
```
After that, Windows Terminal launches the container instantly with no prompts.

## 🧰 Installing PowerShell Modules (Persistent Bootstrap Script)
This container is intentionally sterile — no modules are baked into the image.
Anything you install should live inside your persistent data directory so it survives container rebuilds.

A helper script is included:
```
scripts/Install-AzureModules.ps1
```
Copy this script into your persistent mount:
```
$HOME/pwsh-data/bootstrap/Install-AzureModules.ps1
```
Then run it from inside the container:
```
./mnt/data/bootstrap/Install-AzureModules.ps1
```
What this script installs
This script sets up the complete Microsoft admin toolchain, including:
- Az (Azure Resource Manager)
- Microsoft.Graph (GA + Beta)
- ExchangeOnlineManagement
- MicrosoftTeams
- PnP.PowerShell
- Security & Compliance cmdlets
- Optional legacy modules:
- AzureAD
- AzureADPreview
- MSOnline

It also handles:
- module updates
- forced reinstalls
- removing stale versions
- installing everything into /mnt/data instead of the image
- This keeps the image sterile while giving you a fully‑loaded admin shell.

You can run this script as often as you want to refresh or update modules without rebuilding the container. This keeps the image sterile while giving you a fully loaded, always‑current admin shell.

**Why the container prints a reminder?**
On startup, the container prints:
```
Reminder: Run ./mnt/data/bootstrap/Install-AzureModules.ps1
```
This ensures you don’t forget to install modules into the persistent mount the first time you run the container.

If you store your bootstrap script somewhere else inside ```/mnt/data```, update the reminder path in the Dockerfile accordingly.

## 🧪 Philosophy: A Sterile, Ephemeral Lab
This project exists because I wanted a PowerShell environment that behaves like a clean lab:
- No drift — every container starts identical
- No contamination — nothing leaks into the host
- No bloat — only the required dependencies
- No surprises — deterministic builds
- No Desktop/WSL drama — pure Docker on a real Linux host
    
- The container is meant to be thrown away.
- The image is the only thing that persists.
- Everything else is ephemeral by design.

**Why admin modules aren’t baked into the image?**
- Azure, Microsoft 365, Graph, and Exchange modules change constantly.
- If they were included in the image, the container would drift, break, or require constant rebuilds.
- Installing them into the persistent mount keeps the image sterile and reproducible while letting the admin toolchain stay current.
